# Interviewer
Interviewer is a REST service which allows users to sign up and register questions which they will be asked on a regular basis. 

For example a user might want to track body height, look of their face, or what feels relevant at a given time. For these cases, questions would be "Your current body height?" (asked once a month), "Photo of your face?" (asked every two weeks), and "What is important to you next week?" (asked every Sunday).

Previous entries can be retrieved and edited retrospectively.

The app is currently being developed.
